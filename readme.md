# README
This is an automatic full segmentation  tool based on [Segment-Anything-2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2) and [Segment-Anything-1](https://github.com/zrporz/segment-anything-1). Our tool performs automatic full segmentation of the video, enabling the tracking of each object and the detection of possible new objects.

## Environment Setup
First, clone this repository and submodules
```bash
#SSH
git clone git@github.com:zrporz/AutoSeg-SAM2.git --recursive
```
or
```bash
#HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/zrporz/AutoSeg-SAM2.git --recursive
```



The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`
We use [SAM1](https://github.com/zrporz/segment-anything-1) to provide static segmentation results and use the [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2) to track the static segmentation results. You can install them by the following commands
```bash
### install sam1 and sam2 modules
pip install -e submodule/segment-anything-1
pip install -e submoudle/segment-anything-2
### download checkpoints
cd checkpoints/sam1
bash download.sh
cd ../sam2
bash download.sh
```

## Prepare your data
Please organize your video data as follows
```
|-<video dir>
    |-000001.jpg
    |-000002.jpg
    |-000003.jpg
    |-000004.jpg
    ...
```

or you can use our demo datasets [chickenchicken](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10K_ePOMTjgQhWo1EXbM5aX7IU1EKvsrv/view?usp=sharing) and put it under `videos/chickenchicken`, then run
```bash
bash scripts/chickenchicken.sh
```
